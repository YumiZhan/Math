# Object-oriented Scientific Library (OSL)

## Introduction

Based on GNU Scientific Library (GSL), OSL is built aiming to help solve the numerical problems in scientific researches. OSL utilize an object-oriented method to enormously simplify the program design in numerical solution, so that engineers can concentrate more on solving engineering problems rather than be bothered too much in coding.
